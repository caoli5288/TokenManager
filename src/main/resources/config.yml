# [----------------------------] !!! WARNING !!! [----------------------------]
# 1) All of your previous economy data will be converted to their tokenmanager economy data,
# and commands such as '/eco (essentials)' will no longer function when player is offline.
# please use '/tokenmanager add | remove | set' instead, which supports offline players.
#
# 2) When you have vault hook enabled + have attempted to reset the economy,
# essentials economy data will load as tokenmanager data, which means they
# will still load balances from their essentials userdata file. Best to reset
# essentials economy before resetting tokenmanager data.
#
#  Please be careful with this option!
#    YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED...
